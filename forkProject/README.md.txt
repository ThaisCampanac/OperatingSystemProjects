In this folder, you will see samples 1-5 with sample5 being the code that I created which has a mixture
of subroutine calls, systemcalls, time interrupt, and other elements that have been tested before in other samples.
Samples1-4 are the samples given by the instructor which are downloaded from elearning.

Sample 5 output with time interrupt 55:
HELLO GRADER
bye!
hehe


In addition, you will see project.c which is where my code is and to run my code follow the 
following terminal code 

gcc -o project project.c
./project 30 "sample1.txt"

the 30 is where you put the counter for the time interruptor 
"sample1.txt" can be changed for each sample

Lastly, you will see the a word documents called summary to see more details about my experience
about the project.
